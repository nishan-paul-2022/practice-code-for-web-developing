<!-- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. -->
<!-- Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations. -->
<!-- Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before they are declared. -->

<!-- A function defined as the property of an object, is called a method to the object. -->
<!-- A function designed to create new objects, is called an object constructor. -->\

<!-- The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "function" for functions. -->
