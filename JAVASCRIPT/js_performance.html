<!-- The HTTP specification defines that browsers should not download more than two components in parallel. -->

<!-- Putting our scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first. -->

<!-- If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing). -->
<!-- If async is not present and defer is present: The script is executed when the page has finished parsing. -->
<!-- If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page. -->
