            <h1>JON SNOW</h1>
            Jon Snow, born Aegon Targaryen, is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children of House Stark at Winterfell, but his true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself, in order to protect him from those that sought the complete annihilation of House Targaryen after Robert's Rebellion and to maintain order in the realm.
            In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually chosen as Lord Commander. However, he is later murdered in a mutiny and resurrected by the Red Priestess Melisandre at the behest of Ser Davos Seaworth. Freed from his Night's Watch vows, Jon joins his "half-sister," Sansa Stark, in building an army and together they retake Winterfell from House Bolton at the Battle of the Bastards, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the North. When Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros begins, Jon negotiates with Daenerys Targaryen, Rhaegar's sister, to try and get her help against the White Walkers in the Great War. After successfully capturing a wight and presenting it to the Lannisters as proof that the army of the dead is real, Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys, who he falls in love with, and steps down as King in the North, being named Warden of the North.
            Jon returns to Winterfell with Daenerys and the Targaryen forces, reuniting with his "half-siblings" Arya Stark and Bran Stark and learning of his true parentage. They fight together at the Battle of Ice and Fire, defeating the Night King and preventing the return of the Long Night. Afterwards, Jon aids Daenerys in her resumed campaign to take the Iron Throne.
